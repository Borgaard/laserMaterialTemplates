# laserMaterialTemplates Overview
Material templates for laser cutters are used to understand what to expect from various settings on a variety of materials. These are primarily made for either Lightburn or CorelDraw, however they can be easily adapted to common settings used in Inkscape and Illustrator.

# How to use
You will likely need to engrave in multiple separate jobs before cutting out the final template.
- Download file of your choice and import into the software you use to operate your laser.
- Ungroup and edit:
  - Material type and thickness
  - Wattage and name/type of your laser (helpful if you have more than one)
  - Engrave speed (this should be consistent throughout the entire template)
  - Interval/DPI/Scan/Gap
- Modify file as needed, such as resizing, reducing parameters (power levels, for example).
- Align, focus, and engrave your material. You will likely need to run multiple engravings to change settings.
- Cut last.

# Tips
- Engrave first. Why? Material can shift/drop/warp after cutting, so engraving first helps keep the focal distance you set. 
- Cut inner pieces before outer. Why? Much like engraving, it's important your material stays in the focal distance you set. Cutting outer pieces releases your material from the stress that keeps it in place, thus increasing the chance smaller pieces cut later won't be in focus.

# Tricks to try (treats not included)
- Change engraving direction (top -> downward / bottom -> upward). Direction of airflow can make a noticeable difference in burn markings.

# Vocabulary
#### Gantry
The dragchain track that supports the laser's head to travel left and right.

#### Interval/DPI/Scan/Gap
These are effectively all the same function. While speed is determined by the laser's head passing back and forth along the gantry, Interval/DPI/Scan/Gap is the distance the gantry moves with each pass.
